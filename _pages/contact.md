#### Collaborate on a project (Industry & Universities)
We are excited to work with industry, non-profits, and other researchers through collaborative projects and consulting. Dr. Sam Michalka brings experience in cognitive neuroscience, data analysis, and engineering. Olin College faculty own and control our intellectual property, supporting easy collaboration with industry. Our engineering students are bright, enthusiastic, and prepared for hands-on projects. Email Dr. Michalka to discuss potential projects.

Companies may also be interested sponsoring a [senior capstone project](http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/scope/).
