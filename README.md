# Human Augmentation Lab (HAL) website

The Human Augmentation Lab (HAL) is a research group at Olin College of Engineering directed by Dr. Sam Michalka. Our work aims to understand human attention and memory and to use this knowledge to develop personal technological devices that can respond to our intentions and cognitive states. 

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. Thanks to the Allan Lab who provided this template (https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab).
